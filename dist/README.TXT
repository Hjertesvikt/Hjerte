This build of Hjerte is provided for convenience, but it is not the most recent, nor the most stable.

To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and
type the following:

java -jar "Hjerte.jar" 

To distribute this project, zip up this jar and a ./lib folder that includes the HjerteLib jar)
and distribute the ZIP file.

Important note:
If you want to test the last version of Hjerte you should compile yourself this project and use the HjertLib jar that you will also compile by yourself.
Normally you should have no problem of Java version as it is Java 1.2 compliant!
